# HOLLMWOOD: Unleashing the Creativity of Large Language Models in Screenwriting via Role Playing (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11683) - June, 2024

Generative AI has demonstrated unprecedented
creativity in artistic creation, especially in the
field of computer vision, yet such phenomena
have not been observed in natural language
processing. In particular, large language models (LLMs) can hardly produce written works
at the level of human experts due to the extremely high complexity of literature writing.
In this paper, we present HOLLMWOOD, an
automated framework for unleashing the creativity of LLMs and exploring their potential
in screenwriting, which is a highly demanding
task. Mimicking the human creative process,
we assign LLMs to different roles involved in
the real-world scenario. In addition to the common practice of treating LLMs as Writer, we
also apply LLMs as Editor, who is responsible
for providing feedback and revision advice to
Writer. Besides, to enrich the characters and
deepen the plots, we introduce a role-playing
mechanism and adopt LLMs as Actors that can
communicate and interact with each other. Evaluations on automatically generated screenplays
show that HOLLMWOOD substantially outperforms strong baselines in terms of coherence,
relevance, interestingness and overall quality
