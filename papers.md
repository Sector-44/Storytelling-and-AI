# PodAgent: A Comprehensive Framework for Podcast Generation (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00455) - March, 2025
Existing automatic audio generation methods
struggle to generate podcast-like audio programs effectively. The key challenges lie in
in-depth content generation, appropriate and expressive voice production. This paper proposed
PodAgent, a comprehensive framework for creating audio programs. PodAgent 1) generates
informative topic-discussion content by designing a Host-Guest-Writer multi-agent collaboration system, 2) builds a voice pool for suitable voice-role matching and 3) utilizes LLMenhanced speech synthesis method to generate
expressive conversational speech. Given the
absence of standardized evaluation criteria for
podcast-like audio generation, we developed
comprehensive assessment guidelines to effectively evaluate the model’s performance. Experimental results demonstrate PodAgent’s effectiveness, significantly surpassing direct GPT-4
generation in topic-discussion dialogue content, achieving an 87.4% voice-matching accuracy, and producing more expressive speech
through LLM-guided synthesis. Demo page:

# Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16153) - February, 2025
With the rise of AI technologies and their growing influence in
the screenwriting field, understanding the opportunities and concerns related to AI’s role in screenwriting is essential for enhancing
human-AI co-creation. Through semi-structured interviews with
23 screenwriters, we explored their creative practices, attitudes,
and expectations in collaborating with AI for screenwriting. Based
on participants’ responses, we identified the key stages in which
they commonly integrated AI, including story structure & plot development, screenplay text, goal & idea generation, and dialogue.
Then, we examined how different attitudes toward AI integration
influence screenwriters’ practices across various workflow stages
and their broader impact on the industry. Additionally, we categorized their expected assistance using four distinct roles of AI: actor,
audience, expert, and executor. Our findings provide insights into
AI’s impact on screenwriting practices and offer suggestions on
how AI can benefit the future of screenwriting.

# HOLLMWOOD: Unleashing the Creativity of Large Language Models in Screenwriting via Role Playing (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11683) - June, 2024
Generative AI has demonstrated unprecedented
creativity in artistic creation, especially in the
field of computer vision, yet such phenomena
have not been observed in natural language
processing. In particular, large language models (LLMs) can hardly produce written works
at the level of human experts due to the extremely high complexity of literature writing.
In this paper, we present HOLLMWOOD, an
automated framework for unleashing the creativity of LLMs and exploring their potential
in screenwriting, which is a highly demanding
task. Mimicking the human creative process,
we assign LLMs to different roles involved in
the real-world scenario. In addition to the common practice of treating LLMs as Writer, we
also apply LLMs as Editor, who is responsible
for providing feedback and revision advice to
Writer. Besides, to enrich the characters and
deepen the plots, we introduce a role-playing
mechanism and adopt LLMs as Actors that can
communicate and interact with each other. Evaluations on automatically generated screenplays
show that HOLLMWOOD substantially outperforms strong baselines in terms of coherence,
relevance, interestingness and overall quality
